		<h1>Nick's Scratch Project!</h1>
		<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118999360/#editor">

		<p> This project took time and patience to complete. The goal was to be able to
			move your head back and forth and learn from it. I followed the instructions provided 
			to me by the PLTW website. This is the reason why I successfully got my head to move 
			how I wanted it to move.

		<p> In this project, my partner Justin and I, did our best to create a game from scratch.
			We decided to make the game about a fly trying to avoid the Pidgeys. The player would control
			the fly and try his or her best to live for as long as they can. We had some
			difficulties but in the end we got the game to work the way we wanted. You can see
			our scrum backlog

		<p>This project took much longer than I expected and it was a lot harder than expected as well. In 
			my project you can decide to learn about Satan, Creon, or even hubris if you do not know what 
			it is. I did the best I could to make this project interactive and informative. The flowchart
			did help once I was able understand how to make it. You can see my flowchart

		<p>This project was made by Mateo and I. We wanted to make a madlib game where two players would 
			insert the best words they could into the madlib and the players would give the point to whoevers 
			madlib was the best. We worked hard on this game to make it as good as it can be. Sometimes a 
			certain part of the game wouldn't work so it was a little difficult finding the problem and than fixing it. 
			However, we ended up getting it done and it turned out how we wanted it to be.

			<h1>Data Project</h1>

		<p>The Data Project was a unique as well as a interesting project. Our group
			was trying to find out if video games correlate with crimes commited
			by children under 18. The project was difficult and trying to find the
			data that was required was tedious. However, it was woth the effort once
			we were able to finish the project. You can see our files 
			<a href="../Data_Project1/Data Project1.zip">here.</a>

			<h1>4.2.3 Simulation Project</h1>
			<img src="../4.2.3 NPaz and KPang/Simulation.PNG"></img>
		<p>This is the Simulation Project that me and my partner Kelly Pang completed.
			We used NetLogo and the the simulation we choose was the Virus simulation.
			We based this simulation off of the 1918 Flu Pandemic or also known as the 
			Spanish Flu.
